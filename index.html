    <title>How to deal with someone who always think ahead of himself/herself?</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>When I say someone thinks ahead of himself/herself, for example, I was encouraging my wife to apply for a graduate school in Asia since she has always wanted to try to live in Asia for a couple of years; however, her immediate resonse was to ask why my plan is if we have to move there. She sounded like she already got admitted already, even without looking into any school.</P>

    <p>I guess you can call this -"Talk the talk, walk the walk".</p>
